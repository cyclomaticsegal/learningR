* Why is machine generated big data useful?

- Used to enable real time actions

- In-situ bring computation where the data is located (airplanes)
  * Allows realtime notification and subsequent actions
  * Design differently
    - monitor in realtime
  * requires more scalable systems (CLOUD like azure and amazon)
- See affects of such changes in SCADA systems
  * Supervisory Control and Data Acquistion
  * Remove monitoring and control across sites and sensors in the pyhsical world
  * helps to enable actions to reduce waste and improve efficiency in industrial processes including manufacturing or power gen 
* As the largest generator of big data - machine data can enable real time actions, however
  * a culture shift is needed towards computing and realtime action
