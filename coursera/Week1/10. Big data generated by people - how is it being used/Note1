- TURNING UNSTRUCTURED DATA GENERATED BY PEOPLE INTO VALUABLE INSIGHTS (THIS IS EDISCOVERY IN A NUTSHELL)

* Business culture is shifting to embrace taking unstructured data and making sense of it
* Open source toolset
* Hadoop is designed to support the processing of large datasets in a distributed computing environment
  - tackling the challenge of volume of unstructured information
  - can handle big batches
  - reatime process of human created data at high velocity
  - Storm and Spark handle data at fast rate / high velocity
  - both integrated data with any database or storage technology
  - ETL does fit big data world because its static
  - NOSQL in the cloud advantages
    * organise data scalable and to suit the problem and objectives
    * Graph dbs
      * if data is used in analysis to find connection between datasets then use graph like Neo4J (graph networks topic later)
    * Key value pairs
      * if data is best accessed using kv pairs like a search engine then use a KV storage system like cassandra
  - Big data must pass throug a series of steps to generate value
    * Acquire
      * Store
        * Retrieve
          * Clean
            * Process
    * best handle by running each stage in layers in architecture and technology
* Sentiment analysis is the big value of people generated big data
* Customer behaviour modelling (like on netflix)
* Predict customer behaviour
* Disaster management (data in the form of pictures and tweets)
* Cisis mappers use sensor data and people gened data and pull in people gen data to create social welfare systems with big data
