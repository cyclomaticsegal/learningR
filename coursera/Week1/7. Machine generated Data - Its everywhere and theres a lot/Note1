- A boeing 747 produces half a TB of data every flight
  * machine generated from variety of sources
- Machine that product sensing data "smart" like a cell phone
- Smart device properties
  * can connect to other devices and networks
  * collect and analyse data autonomously
  * provide environment context
  - This lead to IOT
- Summary
  * increasing number of machines that sense * data collected by each device = machines -> biggest source
