* Evindence only valuable if quality is there
* Quality can be defined as a function of:
  * Accuracy of the data

  - Social media data highly uncertain in expression and content
  - Machine and people generated data is messier and more uncertain
    * Imprecise uncertain
    * High velocity leaves no time for ETL
      - Hindering quality 
* Google flu trends over estimated

  - Don't just rely on only big data in the analysis
  - Identify where the big data comes from
  - What transforms did it go through on its way to analysis
    * Refered to as provenance
