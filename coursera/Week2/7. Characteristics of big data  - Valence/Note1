- CHARACTERISTICS OF BIG DATA : VALENCE

- Valence == Connectedness
  * Term comes from chemistry
  * Higher bonding and connectedness between data
    - Direct and indirect connection
      * A city is connected to a country
      * Two doctors are connected by their profession
- For a data collection, Valence measures the ration of "actually" connected data items to
  - the possible number of connections that could occur within the collection
- The most important aspect of valence
  * Data connectivity increases over time
  * Think of LinkedIn
  * Increasing Valence can lead to emergent group behaviour in people networks
    - Creation of shared groups and coalitions with shared goals.
- High Valence data set is denser
  * Makes regular analytic techniques inefficient
  * More complex analytic techniques are required
  * More intresting challenges arise due to the dynamic behaviour of the data
  - Need to model and predict how the valence of a connected data set will change over time and volume
  - Dynamic behaviour also leads to the problem of event detection
    * Such as bursts in local cohesion in parts of the data
    * Emergent behaviour within the data
      (ie increased polarisation in a community)
