- variety = scale refering to diversity not size

- Complexity  
  * Types of data we need to store and combine
- Not just tables and rows / columns
- Today a much wider variety of data stored to analyse and solve real world problems
  * Image data
  * Text data
  * Geographic maps
  * Network data
  * Computer generated simulations
- Hetrogenity of data can be characterised across several dimensions
  * Structural variety / difference of representation of the data / formats and models
  * Medium variety / medium in which data is delivered (transcript of speech in text vs. audio vs. close caption)
  * Semantic variety / how to interpret and operate on data / different units of measure / qualitative vs. quantatitive 
    - Age as number or classification like infant, juvenille or adult
    - or different assumptions or conditions on the data
      * EG. 
  * Availability
    - Variation of realtime or intermittment
    - Traffic cam realtime or satellite only over region of interest
- Variety within TYPE
  * Email is a hybrid entity
    - structure table like part of header (TO from, cc, subject, mailed-by etc...meta data)
    - Unstructured body which can contain markup (to be reasoned about)
    - Attachmens / multimedia
    - Who sends to whom
    - Threading of email the only way to get relational semantics
    - Email server is realtime but a repository is not
