- Velocity refers to:
  * Increasing speed that big data is created
  * Increasing speed that it needs to be stored
  * Increasing speed that it needs to be analyzed
  - Processing of data in realtime to match its production rate is a goal of big data analytics
  - If business can not take advantage of analysis at the speed data is generated = missed opportunity
- Real time processing
  * Of sensor data for example
  * Different to batch processing
  * Todays sensor driven stream driven real time data requires fast decisions
- How do we make sure we match the velocity of the expectations to gain insight from big data with its velocity?
  * Rate of generation, retrieval or processing of data is app specific
  * The need for realtime data driven actions in a biz case dictates the velocity of anaylitics over big data
    - Precision of 1 minute or 1 day etc
- Paths to choose
  * Speed of data generation:
    - fast
    - slow
      * faster = more $
  * speed of data processing
    - fast
    - slow
      * faster = more $
  * Decsion on path based on:
    - Cost of hardware
    - Time sensitivity of decision making
    - Future scenarios
    - This becomes a business driven question
