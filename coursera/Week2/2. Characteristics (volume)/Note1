- Volumne is the big data dimension that relates to the sheer size of the data
  * Can come from 
    - big data sets being shared
    - many small data pieces
    - events collected over time
- How much are we talking about 
  * The size and scale of the data can be massive
  * Digital data will grow by a factor of 44 until 2020
  * Think of time cost and energy to store 35.2 Zettabytes by 2020
- Exponential growth to data volume and storage
  * Whats the relevance of collecting it?
    - Better insight for business
      * Safety
      * Reliability
      * Healthcare
      * Governance
    - Turning it to advantage is the goal
- The challenges
  * Storage
  * Retrieval and moving it to processing units in a timely fashion to get results
  * Networking, bandwidth and cost of storage (in house vs cloud)
- Most analytic process wont scale to huge amount of data
  * As volume increases performance and cost challenging
